This folder contains the files that need to be copied to the web
server, excluding any binary files such as jar files. When modifying
files on the server, they should first be modified here and then
copied over to the server, rather than the reverse.

Since there are 2 versions of the tool, there are 2 subfolders within
the software folder. The 'sbmt' folder contains the public version
that lacks many features and the 'apl' folder contains the full apl
version.
