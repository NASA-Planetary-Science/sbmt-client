Latest version: VERSIONXXXXXX

The SBMT OREX Version is currently available for Mac, Windows, and Linux systems. It is distributed as a self-contained zip file.

Users new to the SBMT or those wanting to learn more about its functionality can access a [user guide and tutorials from the main website](http://sbmt.jhuapl.edu/index.php#Getting-Started). 

To install the SBMT, download the file appropriate for your operating system, navigate to the sbmt folder, and run the "runsbmt" program.

NOTE: On a Mac, built in Apple security measures may cause you to see an error message the first time you try to run a downloaded version of the SBMT: "runsbmt can't be opened because the identity of the developer cannot be confirmed." Rest assured that the SBMT is safe to run. To open the SBMT for the first time, right-click on the "runsbmt" icon, select "open", and then click the "open" button. The SBMT should then open without further problems, and this additional step will not be necessary until you download a new version of the tool.
