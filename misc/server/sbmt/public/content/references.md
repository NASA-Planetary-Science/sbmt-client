### Gravitational acceleration, gravitational potential, slope, and elevation

-   Gravitational acceleration data and gravitational potential data was
    calculated using an in-house implementation of either the
    algorithm of Werner and Scheeres (Werner, R.A. and Scheeres, D.J.,
    1997, Exterior gravitation of a polyhedron derived and compared
    with harmonic and mascon gravitation representations of asteroid
    4769 Castalia, *Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy*,
    Vol. 65, pp. 313-344) or the algorithm of Andy Cheng (Cheng,
    A.F. et al., 2012, Efficient Calculation of Effective Potential
    and Gravity on Small Bodies, *ACM*, 1667, p. 6447).
-   Slope data was computed as the angular separation in degrees between
    the plate normal vector and the gravitational acceleration vector
    at each plate center. The formula used is as follows: If N is the
    normal vector and A is the acclereration vector, then the slope is
    arccos(-dot(N,A))*180/pi.
-   Elevation data was computed as follows. First a reference
    potential, R,  was computed by averaging the potential weighted by the
    plate area. I.e. R = SUM(P_i*A_i)/SUM(A_i) where P_i is the
    potential at the center of the ith plate and A_i is the area of
    the ith plate. The sum is over all plates. Then the elevation, E, is
    computed as: E = (P_i-R)/g, where g is the magnitude of the
    acceleration vector at the ith plate center.
