title: Small Body Mapping Tool

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

The Small Body Mapping Tool is supported on the following platforms:

-   Windows 7 or higher (64-bit)
-   Linux, recent distributions (64-bit)
-   Mac OS X version 10.5 or higher (64-bit Intel-based Macs only)

In addition, the 64-bit version of Java 6 or 7 must be installed on
your system for Windows or Linux platforms (unless running the Windows
version of the tool below which includes Java). For Mac platforms,
Java 6 must be installed--Java 7 is not supported at this time.

For Windows and Linux platforms, Java can be downloaded from
[http://www.java.com](http://www.java.com), if not already installed
on your system. Make sure to download the 64-bit version of Java, not
the 32-bit version.

On Macs, Java 6 comes either preinstalled (Leopard or Snow Leopard),
or is available as an add-on directly from Apple (Lion or later). The
version of Java available at
[http://www.java.com](http://www.java.com) for Macs, which is Java 7,
will not work with the SBMT. However, even if you've already installed
Java 7, it is not necessary to uninstall it, and the SBMT should be
able to find Java 6 if it is present on your system.

### Download the tool

The Small Body Mapping Tool is distributed as a self-contained zip
file. Download the version appropriate for your platform and follow
the steps below. For the benefit of Windows users, we provide 2
versions of the tool, one with Java and one without. If you download
the version with Java included, then you do not need to install Java
separately on your system.

For those who have previously used the tool, please note that we no
longer support launching it with Java Web Start. The only way to launch
