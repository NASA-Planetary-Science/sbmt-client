### Gravitational acceleration, gravitational potential, slope, and elevation

-   Gravitational acceleration data and gravitational potential data was
    calculated using an in-house implementation of either the
    algorithm of Werner and Scheeres (Werner, R.A. and Scheeres, D.J.,
    1997, Exterior gravitation of a polyhedron derived and compared
    with harmonic and mascon gravitation representations of asteroid
    4769 Castalia, *Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy*,
    Vol. 65, pp. 313-344) or the algorithm of Andy Cheng (Cheng,
    A.F. et al., 2012, Efficient Calculation of Effective Potential
    and Gravity on Small Bodies, *ACM*, 1667, p. 6447). The
    acceleration and potential were evaluated at each plate center
    using one of these algorithms. Also, an additional term was
    added to both the potential and acceleration to correct for the
    rotation of the small body. Values of densities and rotation
    rates were obtained from Wikipedia.
-   Slope data was computed as the angular separation in degrees between
    the plate normal vector and the gravitational acceleration vector
    (computed as explained above) at each plate center. The formula
    used is as follows: If N is the normal vector and A is the
    acceleration vector, then the slope is arccos(-dot(N,A))*180/pi.
-   Elevation data was computed as follows. First a reference potential,
    R, was computed by averaging the potential (computed as explained
    above) weighted by the plate area. I.e. R = SUM(P_i*A_i)/SUM(A_i)
    where P_i is the potential at the center of the ith plate and A_i
    is the area of the ith plate. The sum is over all plates. Then the
    elevation, E, is computed as: E = (P_i-R)/g, where g is the
    magnitude of the acceleration vector at the ith plate center.
