title: Small Body Mapping Tool (APL Version)
---

## Overview

Analyzing and interpreting data returned from small body missions is
currently difficult due to the large amounts of data returned and the
difficult to understand formats in which the data is often stored
in. In addition, the highly irregular shapes of small bodies such as
433 Eros or 25143 Itokawa add further difficulties and 2D-based tools
are not well suited. The Small Body Mapping Tool (SBMT) is a 3D tool
designed to address these issues and attempts to make it easy to
quickly search and visualize small body data.

## Quick Start

located in the 'sbmt' folder in a text editor and enter your username
on the first line and password on the second line. This will allow the
tool to run queries and download data.
