  <title>Alternate Ways to Launch SBMT</title>
</head>
<body>
<br>
There are several ways to launch the SBMT without using a web browser.
In all cases, you will be prompted for your username and password when
outside the lab. In addition, in all cases, the latest available
version of the tool is always run.
<br>
<h3>Command Line (All platforms)</h3>
The SBMT can be started from the command line with the following command:
<pre>

javaws http://near.jhuapl.edu/software/apl/sbmt/near.jnlp

</pre>
<!--
<h3>Executable Jar File (All platforms)</h3>
Download the jar file <a href="sbmt.jar">sbmt.jar</a> to any folder. From within Windows
Explorer on Windows, Finder on Mac, or the standard file browsers on
Linux, double click on sbmt.jar to launch the tool.  In addition, the
tool can be launched from the command line by entering the following
command within the folder containing the jar file:
<pre>

java -jar sbmt.jar

</pre>
-->

<h3>Mac Application Bundle (Mac only)</h3>
Download the file <a href="sbmt-launcher.zip">sbmt-launcher.zip</a> and unzip it to any directory. From within
Finder, you can then double click on the SBMT Launcher application to launch
the tool. In addition, you can drag the application to the Dock and
launch it from there.
<!--
 Note that the icon of the application launcher
itself contains a colorized image of Eros while the icon of a running
instance of the tool contains a grayscale image of Eros.
