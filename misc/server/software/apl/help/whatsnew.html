	<h1>What's New</h1>

	<h3>June 2012</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>When right-clicking on an image, there is now an option to
			change its opacity
		<li>It is now possible to delete an individual vertex from a Path
			(previously, it was necessary to delete the entire path and start
			again). To delete a vertex, press the Delete or Backspace key while
			in Edit mode and the vertex that is blue will be deleted. There's
			only one vertex at a time that's blue, all others are red. The blue
			vertex represents the "current" vertex. To change the current vertex,
			simply click on a new vertex while hovering over it (so that the
			cursor changes to a hand shape).
		<li>Added option to export mapmaker maplet to a plate file.
		<li>In the File menu, there is now an option to automatically
			save 6 images of views along both directions of all 3 axes. This
			option will automatically reorient the view to successively point the
			virtual camera in the positive x, negative x, positive y, negative y,
			positive z, and negative z directions and save an image for each
			view. When prompted to choose a file name in the dialog, the name you
			choose will be modified to indicate each of the six views. For
			example, if you choose the name "image.png", then the following six
			files will get saved out: "image+x.png", "image-x.png",
			"image+y.png", "image-y.png", "image+z.png", and "image-z.png".
		<li>There is now a new tab called "Images" for each View to the
			right of the Structures tab, for both built-in and custom models, so
			instead of specifying images when you create a new custom shape model
			(which previously was the only to import custom images), you would
			now do it in the Images tab, which shows a list of the images you've
			added. To add a new image, press "New" and a dialog will appear in
			which you can specify the image and projection parameters. To edit an
			existing image, click the "Edit" button. And to remove an image from
			the list press "Delete from List". Adding an image doesn't
			immediately make it visible on the renderer. To view it, right-click
			on the image in the list, and press Map Image. To remove it,
			right-click and press Map Image again (clicking Hide also removes
			it--the difference is that Map does all the computation needed to map
			the image to view unlike toggling the Hide option, so using the Hide
			option is faster). To remove all images from the renderer (not from
			the list), press the "Remove All from View".
			<p>The menu that appears when you right-click is the same as the
				one for the MSI and AMICA images, though some options are not
				enabled. The "Properties" option allows you to view a 2D view of the
				image as well as change the contrast (however, contrast stretching
				is currently only supported for grayscale images).
			<p>In addition to the cylindrical projection, I've also added the
				ability to use a perspective projection, which is the same
				projection used to map the original spacecraft images (i.e. MSI or
				AMICA). To do this you need to provide a sumfile in the format that
				Bob Gaskell uses which contains the position and orientation of the
				spacecraft. You also need to provide the angular field of view of
				the camera in degrees for both dimensions (e.g. for AMICA images
				both field of views would be 5.839083 degrees)
			<p>The "Show Image Map" checkbox which you previously would check
				to show the images is no longer present in the custom shape models.
				It is present, however, in several of the built-in models and is
				used to simply show a single image of the entire asteroid.
			<p>Existing lists of images (from custom imported shape models)
				should show up in the list of the Images tab. If this is not the
				case, please let me know.
			<p>Some current limitations to be aware of which I hope to
				address:
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>When doing a perspective projection, the image must be FITS
					format, unlike a cylindrical projection where the image can be png,
					jpg, tiff, etc. (the typical formats), though not FITS.
				<li>As mentioned already, the adjusting contrast stretching is
					only available for single channel images, not color images. If the
					image is really grayscale but stored as a color image (i.e. the 3
					channels are the same), you will need to use some image processing
					software to convert it to a true grayscale format. I hope to add
					stretching for color images as well.
			</ul>
		<li>When rescaling data range of plate data (e.g. Elevation or
			slope), it is now possible to set the min and max values to be less
			than min value of the data or greater than the max value of the data,
			respectively.
		<li>In the File menu, there is now a new Camera option which
			opens a dialog in which you can specify vertical field of view of the
			virtual camera. The default value is 30 degrees. Note that the field
			of view changes if you right click on an MSI or AMICA image and press
			"Center in Window". When you do that, the field of view changes to
			the field of view of the MSI or AMICA camera.
		<li>The Statistics label (at the bottom of the leftmost tab for
			each view) is now selectable, so it is now possible to copy and paste
			the values to another program (with Ctrl-C).
		<li>added options to preferences for setting the pick tolerance
			and interactor style
		<li>There is now and option in the Preferences dialog to switch
			between a "Trackball Interactor Style" and a "Joystick Interactor
			Style". Until now, only the "Trackball" style has been used by the
			tool. The Joystick style provides a different way to navigate around
			the asteroid. One of things you can do with Joystick style is to
			continuously spin the asteroid around, while holding down the left
			mouse button.
		<li>Added SSI tab for Ida and Gaspra, and MSI tab for Mathilde.
			Only a few images are currently available for these asteroids (Simply
			click Search to show a list of images--all the search options are
			currently ignored). Work on adding the remaining images is currently
			in progress.
		<li>Some of the AMICA images of Itokawa are not registered well,
			especially the ones acquired on Nov 12 and Nov 19. We have begun work
			on correcting some of these misregistered images and you can view the
			currently available corrected images by selecting "Corrected" from
			the Source dropdown menu at the top of the AMICA tab and then
			pressing Search (all the search options are ignored in this case).
			Work on adding additional corrected images is currently in progress.

			been clicked until the completion of the circle.
		<li>Fixed inability to save structures when no backplane data is
			available.
		<li>Use superscripts for exponents in Statistics label.
		<li>Fixed problem where values on color bar would not get updated
