## Convert OLA Level 1 lidar data to Level 2

This program is intended to convert OLA level 1 data to level 2 data.
Since the format of OLA level 1 and 2 data has not yet been finalized,
the program currently works with Hayabusa lidar data (EDR) only and
converts it to a format that will be similar to OLA level 2
data. Additional details as well as usage instructions can be found in
the README.txt file contained in the following zip archive.
