   This meta-kernel lists the Hayabusa SPICE kernels providing coverage
   for the surveying and collection phase of the mission. All of the
   kernels listed below are archived in the Hayabusa SPICE data set
   (DATA_SET_ID = "HAY-A-SPICE-6-V1.0"). This set of files and the
   order in which they are listed were picked to provide the best
   available data and the most complete coverage based on the
   information about the kernels available at the time this meta-kernel
   was made. For detailed information about the kernels listed below
   refer to the internal comments included in the kernels and the
   documentation accompanying the Hayabusa SPICE data set.

   It is recommended that users make a local copy of this file and
   modify the value of the PATH_VALUES keyword to point to the actual
   location of the Hayabusa SPICE data set's ``data'' directory on their
   system. Replacing ``/'' with ``\'' and converting line terminators
   to the format native to the user's system may also be required if
   this meta-kernel is to be used on a non-UNIX workstation.

   This file was created on September 28, 2009 by Boris Semenov,
