   This function computes the state (position and velocity) of the target in the observer body frame,
   at the time the spacecraft imaged the body.

   Input:
     et:           Ephemeris time when an image of the body was taken
     spacecraft:   Name of the spacecraft that took the image
     observerBody: Name of observer body (e.g. EROS, PLUTO, PHOEBE)
     targetBody:   Name of target body (e.g. SUN, EARTH). SPICE names can be found at
                   https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/FORTRAN/req/naif_ids.html

   Output:
     bodyToTarget: The position of the target in observer body-fixed coordinates corrected for light time
     velocity:     The velocity of the target in observer body-fixed coordinates corrected for light time
