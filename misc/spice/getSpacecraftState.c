   This function computes the state (position and velocity) of the spacecraft in the observer body frame,
   at the time the spacecraft imaged the body.
   
   Input:
     et:           Ephemeris time when the image was taken
     observerBody: Name of observer body (e.g. EROS, PLUTO)
     spacecraft:   NAIF SPICE name of spacecraft (e.g. NEAR, NH). These can be found at
                   https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/FORTRAN/req/naif_ids.html
   
   Output:
     bodyToSc:     The position of the spacecraft in observer body-fixed coordinates corrected for light time
     velocity:     The velocity of the spacecraft in observer body-fixed coordinates corrected for light time
