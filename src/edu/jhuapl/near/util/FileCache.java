     * This function is used to both download a file from a server as well as to
     * check if the file is out of data and needs to be downloaded. This depends
     * on the doDownloadIfNeeded parameter. If set to true it will download
     * the file if needed using the rules described below. If false, nothing
     * will be downloaded, but the server will be queried to see if a newer
     * version exists.
     *
     * If the file is requested to be actually downloaded from server it is placed
     * in the cache when downloaded so it does not need to be downloaded a second time.
     * The precise rules for determining whether or not we download the file from the
     * server or use the file already in the cache are as follows:
     *
     * - If the file does not exist in the cache, download it. - If the file
     * does exist, and was already downloaded by this very process (files
     * already downloaded are stored in the downloadedFiles hash set), then
     * return the cached file without comparing last modified times. - If the
     * file does exist, and has not been previously downloaded by this process,
     * compare the last modified time of the cached file to the remote file on
     * server. If the remote file is newer, download it, otherwise return the
     * cached file. - If there was a failure connecting to the server simply
     * return the file if it exists in the cache. - If the file could not be
     * retrieved for any reason, null is returned.
     *
     * Note the cache mirrors the file hierarchy on the server.
     *
     * Note also that if the Root URL (as returned by Configuration.getDataRootURL())
     * begins with "file://", then that means the "server" is not really an http server but
     * is really the local disk. In such a situation the cache is not used and the file
     * is returned directly. This is useful for running batch scripts so no http connections
     * are made. If the file is gzipped, you will need to manually gunzip (in the same folder)
     * it in order for the following to work. Remember to leave the gzipped version
     * in place since otherwise you will break the web server!
