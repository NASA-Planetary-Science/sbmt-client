 - Improve NLR. Show plot of range of spacecraft to asteroid vs time.
   Also show plot of potential vs distance (range) traveled. Allow from these
   plots to highlight data in renderer and vs versa. 

 - Allow search region to work for NLR
 
 - Make NLR GUI more similar to MSI and NIS
    
 - Disable ability to save and load from file while drawing a path

 - Improve lighting of shape model so as to better make out the topography.
   Perhaps provide controls for modifying it.
   
 - Undo feature
 
 - overlay lat/lon labels when lat/lon grid is shown
 
 - replace joda time with orekit's time handling. Will require regenerating the databases
 
 - if an msi image was shown and then removed and then the resolution level changes, the msi
   image not being shown will still recompute itself for the new resolution level. Prevent this
   from happening.
   
 - reduce memory usage, especially when large models are shown.
 
 - improve speed of intersecting a frustum with the asteroid, especially important for
   large models. Possible things to consider:
   1. ignore the largest connected component which consists of, say, at least 90% of the entire image
   	  when doing the intersection calculations
   2. run a vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry prior to vtkClipPolyData
   
 - modify the shape models so that a "seam" does not appear when texture mapping an image
   to the entire model at once, which is what happened with Deimos
   
 - Add ability to load a new shape model at runtime in a new View
 
 - fix problem where if you right click and create a popup menu, you continue to zoom in
   and out
   
 - add ability to reorient the camera along any of the axes as requested by Carolyn
