 - Improve NLR. Show plot of range of spacecraft to asteroid vs time.
   Also show plot of potential vs distance (range) traveled. Allow from these
   plots to highlight data in renderer and vs versa. 

 - Allow search region to work for NLR
 
 - Make NLR GUI more similar to MSI and NIS
    
 - Disable ability to save and load from file while drawing a path

 - Improve lighting of shape model so as to better make out the topography.
   Perhaps provide controls for modifying it. In particular, remove the glaring
   effect especially noticeable at the ends of eros
   
 - Undo feature
 
 - overlay lat/lon labels when lat/lon grid is shown
 
 - replace joda time with orekit's time handling. Will require regenerating the databases
 
 - if an msi image was shown and then removed and then the resolution level changes, the msi
   image not being shown will still recompute itself for the new resolution level. Prevent this
   from happening.
   
 - reduce memory usage, especially when large models are shown.
 
 - improve speed of intersecting a frustum with the asteroid, especially important for
   large models. Possible things to consider:
   1. ignore the largest connected component which consists of, say, at least 90% of the entire image
   	  when doing the intersection calculations
   2. run a vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry prior to vtkClipPolyData
   
 - modify the shape models so that a "seam" does not appear when texture mapping an image
   to the entire model at once, which is what happened with Deimos
   
 - Add ability to load a new shape model at runtime in a new View
 
 - fix problem where if you right click and create a popup menu, you continue to zoom in
   and out
   
 - add ability to reorient the camera along any of the axes as requested by Carolyn
 
 - fix crash which occurs sometimes if you click with mouse on the renderer while
   a resolution change is taking place
   
 - in backplane generation, add the elevation, slope, etc values as new planes
 
 - for people using macs, the width of the control panel is too narrow
 
 - use interpolation within a plate for the elevation, slope etc. (similar to smooth shading)
 
 - add options for changing colors of drawn structures such as circles and lines.
   perhaps save the color to each line of the file. also provide controls for
   changing color of individual structures. 
 
 - improve NLR tab: fix performance. Allow showing all data at once. Allow exporting data.
   Show original tab also (perhaps one for browsing and one for searching)
 
 - develop new high res topography tool: this will work as follows. Create a new tab which
   provides the options to select a point (in lat, west lon) by drawing a circle.
   A ddr cube will be generated at that area using Bob Gaskell's fortran program
   for generating high resolution topography. Bob Gaskell's program takes the
   following input:
    1. a name
    2. lat lon (note lon is west longitude not east as is used by the tool)
    3. half width: i.e. the number of pixels in half the size of width of a plane
    	 of the cube. The maximum is 512 pixels (or 1023 (must be odd) in full length)
    4. size of horizontal pixel in meters per pixel
   Currently the program is interactive. we will need to modify it so all options can be run
   on the command line. 
   Once the ddr is generated, allow user to save it to any location. Also provide option
   for generating profiles (i.e. plot of height vs distance). See the screenshot Carolyn
   sent. Try to reproduce it: show the isosurface lines superimposed on the shaded
   relief map on the left.
   Show multiple profiles at once on the plot. Perhaps show each in a different color to
   distinguish clearly. Perhaps show A at the start of the profile and A' at the end so
   as to distinguish the beginning and end of a profile.
   Provide ability to export profiles to a text file. Probably a single profile per
   file.
   On the asteroid, show the outline of the ddr (similar to how outlines of msi images
   are shown when searching). Provide ability to save outline to file.
   If possible it should be possible to load in this outline and ddr and continue work
   from there (i.e. to be able to generate new profiles) in situations where user
   closes tool and would like to resume work later.
   It will be necessary to first download all topographic data to users machine before
   first use.
