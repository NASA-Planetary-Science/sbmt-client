 - Improve NLR. Show plot of range of spacecraft to asteroid vs time.
   Also show plot of potential vs distance (range) traveled. Allow from these
   plots to highlight data in renderer and vs versa. 

 - Allow search region to work for NLR
 
 - Make NLR GUI more similar to MSI and NIS
    
 - improve NLR tab: fix performance. Allow showing all data at once. Allow exporting data.
   Show original tab also (perhaps one for browsing and one for searching)

 - In NLR tool, provide ability to click on a point and then search for the entire
   track which contains that point. Tracks can be distinguished based on time (i.e. if there
   is a long break in time, then you know the track ended). Allow user to:
   1. highlight the track
   2. remove the track
   3. export the track
   4. plot the track
   
 - In NLR tab, default start and stop times should include entire mission. Since the data
   returned would be too large for such a search, provide a popup warning urging user to select
   a region.
   
 - Provide new summary tab in NLR showing all the NLR data
  
 - In NLR Plots, don't show lines connecting the points, just show the points
 
 - In NLR tab, provide checkbox for not showing points whose invalid flag is true (i.e. filter on invalid flag)
 
 - In NLR tab, when showing the plots, add a new 3D plot just showing the points and a set of axes (XYZ)
 
 - In NLR tab, when plotting potential vs distance, the distance should be computed by fitting
   a straight line through the points (using least squares), and then projecting the point onto
   the line. The distance along this line is what should be plotted, not the euclidean distance
   between points as is done now.
   
 - Show a popup progress bar dialog for long running operations which leave the tool hanging
 
 - Disable ability to save and load from file while drawing a path

 - Undo feature
 
 - overlay lat/lon labels when lat/lon grid is shown
 
 - replace joda time with orekit's time handling. Will require regenerating the databases
 
 - if an msi image was shown and then removed and then the resolution level changes, the msi
   image not being shown will still recompute itself for the new resolution level. Prevent this
   from happening.
   
 - reduce memory usage, especially when large models are shown.
 
 - improve speed of intersecting a frustum with the asteroid, especially important for
   large models. Possible things to consider:
   1. ignore the largest connected component which consists of, say, at least 90% of the entire image
   	  when doing the intersection calculations
   2. run a vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry prior to vtkClipPolyData
   
 - modify the shape models so that a "seam" does not appear when texture mapping an image
   to the entire model at once, which is what happened with Deimos
   
 - Add ability to load a new shape model at runtime in a new View
 
 - add ability to reorient the camera along any of the axes as requested by Carolyn
 
 - fix crash which occurs sometimes if you click with mouse on the renderer while
   a resolution change is taking place
   
 - in backplane generation, add the elevation, slope, etc values as new planes
 
 - for people using macs, the width of the control panel is too narrow
 
 - use interpolation within a plate for the elevation, slope etc. (similar to smooth shading)
 
 - add options for changing colors of drawn structures such as circles and lines.
   perhaps save the color to each line of the file. also provide controls for
   changing color of individual structures. 
 
 - In NIS tab, allow coloring of footprints using 3 channels (currently only 1 channel is
   supported) thus enabling full RGB color footprints. Also provide checkbox option for dividing
   spectrum by the cosine of the incidence (cos I)
   
 - In path structures drawing, allow deletion of single vertex, (currently only
   deleting the entire path is supported)

 - In structures tab, provide new structure tab called Polygons for drawing arbitrary polygons.
   This will be very similar to paths tab plus the following features:
   1. Polygons will be filled in
   2. (possibly) double clicking somehow finishes the drawing (not sure exactly)
 
 - develop new high res topography tool: this will work as follows. Create a new tab which
   provides the options to select a point (in lat, west lon) by drawing a circle.
   A ddr cube will be generated at that area using Bob Gaskell's fortran program
   for generating high resolution topography. Bob Gaskell's program takes the
   following input:
    1. a name
    2. lat lon (note lon is west longitude not east as is used by the tool)
    3. half width: i.e. the number of pixels in half the size of width of a plane
    	 of the cube. The maximum is 512 pixels (or 1023 (must be odd) in full length)
    4. size of horizontal pixel in meters per pixel
   Currently the program is interactive. we will need to modify it so all options can be run
   on the command line. 
   Once the ddr is generated, allow user to save it to any location. Also provide option
   for generating profiles (i.e. plot of height vs distance). See the screenshot Carolyn
   sent. Try to reproduce it: show the isosurface lines superimposed on the shaded
   relief map on the left.
   Show multiple profiles at once on the plot. Perhaps show each in a different color to
   distinguish clearly. Perhaps show A at the start of the profile and A' at the end so
   as to distinguish the beginning and end of a profile.
   Provide ability to export profiles to a text file. Probably a single profile per
   file.
   On the asteroid, show the outline of the ddr (similar to how outlines of msi images
   are shown when searching). Provide ability to save outline to file.
   If possible it should be possible to load in this outline and ddr and continue work
   from there (i.e. to be able to generate new profiles) in situations where user
   closes tool and would like to resume work later.
   It will be necessary to first download all topographic data to users machine before
   first use.
   
 - In NIS and MSI allow creation of mosiacs by specifically specifying the offset size for each
   footprint or image. Provide menu option in popup for "bring to front" like in Powerpoint

 - In NIS, provide export of data. Use the following format: First a header in a key = value format
   format, then a table of the wavelengths and reflectances:
   	MET = blah
   	X = 3
   	Y = 4
   	Z = 5
   	Wavelength, Reflectance, ...
   	1, 2, ...
   	...
   	...
   	
 - provide option (e.g. a checkbox) to show frustum in renderer for msi and nis footprints
 
 - In SmallBodyModel replace the 4 coloring arrays with a hashmap that maps color names to
   the coloring data. What if we eventually want to add a fifth coloring type?
