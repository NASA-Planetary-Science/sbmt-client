 - Improve NLR. Show plot of range of spacecraft to asteroid vs time.
   Also show plot of potential vs distance (range) traveled. Allow from these
   plots to highlight data in renderer and vs versa. 

 - Make NLR GUI more similar to MSI and NIS
    
 - improve NLR tab: fix performance. Allow showing all data at once. Allow exporting data.
   Show original tab also (perhaps one for browsing and one for searching)

 - In NLR tool, provide ability to click on a point and then search for the entire
   track which contains that point. Tracks can be distinguished based on time (i.e. if there
   is a long break in time, then you know the track ended). Allow user to:
   1. highlight the track
   2. remove the track
   3. export the track
   4. plot the track
   
 - In NLR tab, default start and stop times should include entire mission. Since the data
   returned would be too large for such a search, provide a popup warning urging user to select
   a region.
   
 - Provide new summary tab in NLR showing all the NLR data
  
 - In NLR Plots, don't show lines connecting the points, just show the points
 
 - In NLR tab, provide checkbox for not showing points whose invalid flag is true (i.e. filter on invalid flag)
 
 - In NLR tab, when showing the plots, add a new 3D plot just showing the points and a set of axes (XYZ)
 
 - In NLR tab, when plotting potential vs distance, the distance should be computed by fitting
   a straight line through the points (using least squares), and then projecting the point onto
   the line. The distance along this line is what should be plotted, not the euclidean distance
   between points as is done now.
   
 - Show a popup progress bar dialog for long running operations which leave the tool hanging
 
 - Disable ability to save and load from file while drawing a path

 - Undo feature
 
 - overlay lat/lon labels when lat/lon grid is shown
 
 - replace joda time with orekit's time handling. Will require regenerating the databases
 
 - reduce memory usage, especially when large models are shown.
 
 - improve speed of intersecting a frustum with the asteroid, especially important for
   large models. Possible things to consider:
   1. ignore the largest connected component which consists of, say, at least 90% of the entire image
   	  when doing the intersection calculations
   2. run a vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry prior to vtkClipPolyData
   
 - modify the shape models so that a "seam" does not appear when texture mapping an image
   to the entire model at once, which is what happened with Deimos
   
 - Add ability to load a new shape model at runtime in a new View
 
 - fix crash which occurs sometimes if you click with mouse on the renderer while
   a resolution change is taking place
   
 - for people using macs, the width of the control panel is too narrow
 
 - In NIS tab, allow coloring of footprints using 3 channels (currently only 1 channel is
   supported) thus enabling full RGB color footprints. Also provide checkbox option for dividing
   spectrum by the cosine of the incidence (cos I)
   
 - In path structures drawing, allow deletion of single vertex, (currently only
   deleting the entire path is supported)

 - In structures tab, provide new structure tab called Polygons for drawing arbitrary polygons.
   This will be very similar to paths tab plus the following features:
   1. Polygons will be filled in
   2. (possibly) double clicking somehow finishes the drawing (not sure exactly)

 - Get maplets tool working on Windows
   
 - Provide ability to save outline of maplets shown on asteroid to file.
 
 - In NIS and MSI allow creation of mosiacs by specifically specifying the offset size for each
   footprint or image. Provide menu option in popup for "bring to front" like in Powerpoint

 - In NIS, provide export of data. Use the following format: First a header in a key = value format
   format, then a table of the wavelengths and reflectances:
   	MET = blah
   	X = 3
   	Y = 4
   	Z = 5
   	Wavelength, Reflectance, ...
   	1, 2, ...
   	...
   	...
   	
 - In the Eros, Deimos, Itokawa, and Vesta tabs, show some statistics
   about the asteroid such as number of plates, points, volume,
   surface area, mean size of plate, bounding box etc.

 - when loading a maplet, add error dialog if we cannot find the lbl file
 
 - (Scott Murchie suggestion) when searching for MSI images, provide options for searching for
   a specific sequence as documented in a spreadsheet he provided
  
 - (Scott Murchie suggestion) when texture mapping MSI images, don't show the black band on 
   the left or right
    
 - add ability to temporary hide a given actor   
 
 - Remove .FIT extension from results returned from MSI search (see getMSIPath in Query.java)
   since not really needed (requires modification to all places that use it)
   
 - change layout of all tabs to use MigLayout especially MSI and NIS

 - In the lists in the MSI, NIS, and NLR tabs, change background color of list
   items that are currently visible in the renderer.
